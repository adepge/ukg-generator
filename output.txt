Abstract
Background
Cognitive impairment has multiple risk factors spanning several domains, but few studies
have evaluated risk factor clusters. We aimed to identify naturally occurring clusters of risk
factors of poor cognition among middle-aged and older adults and evaluate associations
between measures of cognition and these risk factor clusters.
Methods
We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III
(training dataset, n = 4074) and the NHANES 2011–2014 (validation dataset, n = 2510).
Risk factors were selected based on the literature. We used both traditional logistic mod-
els and support vector machine methods to construct a composite score of risk factor
clusters. We evaluated associations between the risk score and cognitive performance
using the logistic model by estimating odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals
(CI).
Results
Using the training dataset, we developed a composite risk score that predicted undiagnosed
cognitive decline based on ten selected predictive risk factors including age, waist circum-
ference, healthy eating index, race, education, income, physical activity, diabetes, hyper-
cholesterolemia, and annual visit to dentist. The risk score was significantly associated with
poor cognitive performance both in the training dataset (OR Tertile 3 verse tertile 1 = 8.15, 95%
CI: 5.36–12.4) and validation dataset (OR Tertile 3 verse tertile 1 = 4.31, 95% CI: 2.62–7.08).
The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve for the predictive model was
0.74 and 0.77 for crude model and model adjusted for age, sex, and race.

Conclusion
The model based on selected risk factors may be used to identify high risk individuals with
cognitive impairment.
Introduction
Between 29% and 76% of patients with dementia may remain undiagnosed [1–3] even though
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommends the assessment of impaired cog-
nition for older individuals at annual wellness visits. As routine screening for impaired cogni-
tion is not recommended, evaluation or diagnosis of impaired cognition results from
complaints by the individual or caregiver or provider suspicion [4].
Increasing age and the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene are the strongest predictors of
impaired cognition [5], but several other factors are correlated with impaired cognition
including blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, alcohol use, diet, physical activity, serum choles-
terol [6, 7], and oral health status [8]. With the exception of age and the ε4 allele of the apolipo-
protein E gene, these factors are potentially modifiable to prevent or delay cognitive decline.
Blood pressure, blood sugar, serum cholesterol smoking, alcohol use, diet, and physical activ-
ity, were part of the Brain Care Score which predicted incident dementia, suggesting that
improving the Brain Risk Score could reduce dementia risk [9]. While information on these
risk factors is often present in medical records, a formal way of including them in the assess-
ment of impaired cognition is challenging. We included information on oral health status in
addition to other risk factors, including those mentioned above, because oral health status is
correlated with poor cognition but infrequently included in risk scores. Moreover, this infor-
mation is typically present in electronic health records and was available in the dataset that we
were planning to use.
The goal of this study was to create and validate a score predicting the prevalence of
impaired cognition in older adults from information on known risk factors using statistical
and machine learning methods. A validated algorithm embedded into electronic health rec-
ords could use pertinent information available in health records to calculate the likelihood of
impaired cognition of their patient using all available data and cue the health care provider.
Formal screening of individuals identified following this impaired cognition score could
potentially increase the positive predictive value of existing screening tools such as the Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE).
Methods
Data source
We used a subset of cross-sectional data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES III) which had measures of cognition for participants 40 years and
older [10] and its commonly known risk factors as the data source to develop a impaired cog-
nition score predicting impaired cognition. We called this the training dataset. The validation
dataset consisted of cross-sectional information from participants of continuous NHANES
surveys 2011 through 2014 who were 60 years and older with data on cognitive assessment and
covariates [11]. This validation dataset was used to confirm the ability of the impaired cogni-
tion score developed in the training dataset to predict impaired cognition, and estimate its sen-
sitivity and specificity.

There were 7,869 participants in the training dataset (NHANES III) and 19,931 participants
in the validation dataset (NHANES 2011–2014). In the training dataset, 3795 participants were
excluded because of missing values in covariates or cognition variables. Similarly, 16,259 par-
ticipants in the validation dataset were excluded for no valid measurement for cognition and
962 for missing values in covariates. After exclusions, 4074 and 2510 participants remained in
the training and validation datasets respectively (S1 Fig in S1 Appendix). NHANES III partici-
pants consented to participate in the study voluntarily. The data used in these analyses was dei-
dentified and classified as exempt from review by the Institutional Review Board of the
University of South Carolina.
Exposure assessment
Training dataset.
Predictive factors consisted of sociodemographic factors which
included age, sex (male and female), race (white, black, and other), educational level (<12 years,
12 years completed education), poverty income ratio (PIR) divided into three groups (1.3,
1.3<PIR3.5, >3.5) (a value <1 indicates that household income is below poverty level, a value
of 1.3 means that household income is 30% above poverty level and so on. The higher this num-
ber the wealthier the household), lifestyle factors consisting of smoking status (non-smoker,
ever smoker, and current smoker), drinking status (non-drinker and drinker), healthy eating
index (HEI) (higher number indicating healthier diet), health related factors including, body
mass index (BMI) (normal: 24.9 kg/m2; overweight: 25 to 29.9 kg/m2, and obese: 30 kg/
m2), waist circumference (in cm), physical activity (derived based on a structured physical activ-
ity questionnaire, and further classified as three groups: sedentary, moderate, vigorous), systolic
blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive
protein (CRP), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), triglycerides, dis-
ease prevalence including diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and depres-
sion, oral health information consisting of periodontal disease (none or mild versus moderate
or severe) [12, 13], and annual dentist visits, and social connectedness measures consisting of
frequency of talking to friends and family, visiting friends and family, attending church services
and club meetings. Details about these variables are available at the CDC website [11, 12].
Validation dataset.
Covariates measured included age in years, sex (male and female),
race (white, black, and other), education ((<12 years, 12 years completed education), PIR
(1.3, 1.3<PIR3.5, >3.5), smoking (non-smoker, ever smoker, and current smoker), drink-
ing status (non-drinker and drinker), HEI score, BMI (normal: 24.9 kg/m2; overweight: 25
to 29.9 kg/m2, and obese: 30 kg/m2), waist circumference, physical activity (sedentary,
moderate, vigorous), SBP, DBP, WBC, total cholesterol, HDL, triglycerides, history of diabetes,
hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and depression, periodontal diseases, and
annual dentist visits. The detailed collection methods for these covariates were similar to the
training dataset.
Cognition assessment
Training dataset.
Cognition was measured using a version of the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE), which was administered through a home interview and at the Mobile
Examination Center (MEC) [14–16]. It consisted of six orientation, six recall, and five atten-
tion related questions. Each correct response was assigned 1 point and an incorrect response
received a score of 0. The outcome used in these analyses was the total score, which was
obtained by summing the points assigned to the responses and ranged from 0 to 17 with higher
scores indicating better cognitive function. The six orientation items asked about the day of
the week, the date, and participant’s complete address including street, city or town, state, and

ZIP code (adult questionnaire). To evaluate recall, the interviewer told the participant the
names of three items (apple, table, and penny) and asked them to repeat the names. Each par-
ticipant was given up to six tries to learn the words. If they correctly recalled the items at any
of the six tries, the response was considered to be correct. This exercise was repeated after
assessing attention to achieve a maximum of 6 points for recall. To evaluate attention, the
interviewer asked the participant to serially subtract 3 from 20 and repeat this exercise for up
to five times. For example, they were asked to subtract $3 from $20, and $3 from $17, and so
on and assigned one point for each correct answer. Based on the prevalence of cognitive
impairment among US older adults [17], we defined cognitive impairment as the lowest 10%
of the distribution (total score = 10) of the MMSE score.
Validation dataset.
Cognition was measured using three tests consisting of the Consor-
tium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD), the Animal Fluency (AF) test,
and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) [18]. The CERAD model assesses both imme-
diate and delayed memory of new verbal information [19], the AF test assesses the verbal flu-
ency domain of executive function [20], and DSST assesses attention and processing speed. A
score, which is the sum of the total number of correct symbols and number pairs within the
time frame was assigned. The assessment was done at the MEC. Individuals in the lowest 10%
of the score distribution were categorized as cognitively impaired. Details are provided in S1
Appendix. We also used the percentile 20% in the sensitivity analyses.
Statistical analysis
We developed models to predict cognitive impairment in NHANES III data (training dataset)
using logistic regression and machine learning (support vector machine). We used machine
learning methods to supplement the logistic regression models because they do not depend on
the same modeling assumption. Comparing the results from the machine learning would
increase our confidence that the final logistic regression models included all the important var-
iables. We further used those models to predict cognitive impairment in the NHANES 2011
through 2014 (validation dataset). We chose the validation dataset because it had most of the
variables that were measured in the training dataset.
Training logistic regression model.
The binary outcome for cognitive impairment was
related to the predictors (cognition-related risk factors) in forward, backward, and stepwise
models, from which the most predictive model was selected. We derived the beta coefficients
for each variable from the most predictive model to construct the impaired cognition score.
Training support-vector machine (SVM) learning models. We next obtained predictive
models in the developmental dataset by relating the outcome (cognitive impairment) with the pre-
dictor variables using SVM. We used the 5-fold cross validation method with 30 replications to get
the best estimation of the model. We ranked the contribution of each feature and compared the top
15 features from the SVM based on the development and validation datasets (Fig 1). Finally, we con-
structed the impaired cognition score based on the logistic model using the following formula:

To evaluate the performance of the prediction models obtained in the
training dataset to external data, we used the final prediction model (logistic model) obtained

from NHANES III data to predict impaired cognition in the continuous NHANES 2011
through 2014 data. To do that we calculated a impaired cognition score for each participant
using the final logistic regression models obtained earlier and categorized the impaired cogni-
tion score into tertiles (low risk, moderate risk, and high risk). We estimated the odds ratios
(OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) using logistic regression to evaluate
the association between the impaired cognition score in tertiles and the outcome (impaired
cognition) adjusting for age, sex, and race (Table 3). We then calculated the area under the
curve (AUC) graphs to assess the prediction performance (Fig 1).
Data management and statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC). The SVM model was performed in R program (Version 3.5.0, R core team, Vienna,
Austria) with the “e1071” package. The sample weights provided by NHANES III were used in
all procedures. The threshold for statistical significance was 0.05. The manuscript is compliant
with the STROBE statement. The University of South Carolina IRB determined the analyses to
be not Human Subjects research.
Ethical considerations
The NHANES study was approved by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Ethics Review
Board (Protocol #2011–17) and documented consent was obtained from all participants.

(p<0.001), more likely to be African American, had higher systolic blood pressure (p = 0.001),
lower HEI scores (p<0.001), fewer social connection by phone (p<0.001); these individuals
were less likely to have visited a dentist in the past year (p<0.001) and more likely to have peri-
odontal disease (p = 0.01).
In the validation dataset (NHANES 2011–2014), participants with low cognitive perfor-
mance compared with their peers with good cognitive performance were older (p<0.001),
more likely to be African American (<0.001), have higher systolic blood pressure (p<0.001),
lower HEI score (p = 0.001), and visited the dentist less frequently in the last year (p<0.001)
(S1 Table in S1 Appendix).
Associations between predictors and cognition performance
Table 2 describes associations between risk factors and cognition performance in the training
dataset after adjusting for all covariates. The odds of low cognitive performance were greater
with higher age but lower healthy eating index score, fewer social connections by phone, and
fewer social connections in attending church activities. Among the participants of the training
dataset, the odds of low cognition performance 1.30 times higher for every 5-year increase in
age (aOR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.19–1.41), and 1.58 times higher for African Americans compared

with their White peers (aOR = 1.58, 95% CI = 1.15–2.17). The odds of low cognitive perfor-
mance were 6% lower for a 5-unit increase in the healthy eating index score (aOR = 0.94, 95%
CI = 0.89–0.98); 2% lower with more frequent daily social connection by phone (aOR = 0.98,
95% CI = 0.97–0.99); 13% lower with more frequent weekly participation in church activities
(aOR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.76–0.99), and 41% lower among those who visited a dentist in the last
year.
Construction and prediction of the overall impaired cognition score
The top 15 contributors to poor cognitive performance in both the training dataset and valida-
tion datasets are shown in Fig 1. The highest contributor in the validation dataset was educa-
tion. In the training dataset, CRP was the highest contributor. Waist circumference and
physical activity had the same rank in both datasets. Age was part of the top three contributors
in either dataset. Visiting the dentist was ranked tenth in the validation dataset and eleventh in
the training dataset, while healthy eating index and race were among the top ten contributors
in both the training and validation datasets.
Table 3 describes the impaired cognition scores for cognitive performance in the training
and the validation dataset using the logistic and SVM models. In both datasets, there were
higher odds of poor cognition for those in tertiles 2 and 3 when compared to tertile 1. These
findings were similar in both the logistic and SVM models in both datasets. In the training
dataset, the odds of poor cognition among participants in tertile 3 was 8.15 times the odds
among participants in tertile 1 (aOR = 8.15, 95% CI = 5.36–12.4) and 8.77 times that of the
odds among participants in tertile 1 (aOR = 8.77, 95% CI = 5.57–13.8) for the logistic and
SVM models respectively. In the validation dataset, the odds of poor cognition among those in
tertile 3 was 4.31 times the odds of participants in tertile 1 (aOR = 4.31, 95% CI = 2.62–7.08)
and 3.95 times that of the odds among participants in tertile 1 (aOR = 3.95, 95% CI = 2.34–
6.66) for the logistic and SVM models respectively. Using 20% as the cutoff of impaired cogni-
tive performance in the validation dataset yielded similar results (S2 Table in S1 Appendix).

Discussion
We developed a model using statistical and machine learning methods that predicted impaired
cognition using ten known risk factors and validated it in a replication dataset among free-liv-
ing older adults. Information on the risk factors in our model is commonly available in elec-
tronic health records but is not systematically used to predict impaired cognition. The model
could be embedded in an electronic health record system to predict the likelihood of impaired
cognition for individuals using information in their respective health records, which could
assist their health care providers to decide on the next steps. The positive predictive value
would be increased for all tools used to evaluate impaired cognition by screening individuals
identified as high-risk using our model, thus facilitating the diagnosis of impaired cognition
among older adults.
Although the causes of cognitive impairment are not yet completely understood, evidence
of associations between individual risk factors and cognitive loss is accumulating. Besides

increasing age, low education level is associated with higher risk of cognition impairment [21],
Some unhealthy lifestyles, including smoking, lack of physical activity, unhealthy eating are
potential risk factors [22]. In addition, people with diabetes, obesity, depression, hypertension,
and hyperlipidemia have an increased risk of developing cognition decline [23]. However, few
studies focused on a combination of these risk factors. Kivipelto and colleagues developed the
CAIDE impaired cognition score based on modifiable risk factors that predicted the incidence
of dementia over 20 years [24]. Combinations of risk factors have been shown to predict
dementia incidence over time in other prospective studies [5, 25–27]. In contrast, we com-
bined information on risk factors to predict the prevalence of impaired cognition. Our goal
was to facilitate case identification at one moment in time rather than predicting dementia risk
over time. Tolea and colleagues using a modified CAIDE instrument in a cross-sectional analy-
sis reported an AUC of 0.63 to predict mild cognitive impairment versus no impairment [28].
In comparison, AUC estimates to assess impaired cognition in our study ranged from 0.70 to
0.79 in various models.
The USPTF does not recommend routine screening for cognitive impairment in older
adults (65 years) [29] due to the insignificant clinical benefit. Screening tools are effective in
identifying cognitive impairment, do not cause any harm, and but benefits from subsequent
interventions are modest [30]. Early diagnosis of impaired cognition may nevertheless benefit
individuals and their caregivers to manage and monitor the condition and plan for the future,
and health care providers to focus on reversing modifiable risk factors and making appropriate
treatment plans. Among nationally representative older US adults, 12 potentially modifiable
risk factors accounted for 41% of dementia cases overall and 46% and 47% of dementia cases
among African Americans and Hispanics respectively [31]. Another analysis of a nationally
representative sample of US adults identified 8 modifiable risk factors that contributed to
35.9% and 30.1% of ADRD cases in men and women respectively, 40% of cases among African
Americans, and 34% of cases among Hispanics [32]. Additionally, it has been shown that path-
ologic changes in the brain may precede development of symptoms by several years [33].
Together these studies suggest that managing risk factors early, particularly in high-risk
groups, may be beneficial in reducing disease burden. Our model identifies individuals likely

to have impaired cognition which could help health care providers to diagnose impaired
cognition.
Our study has several strengths. We applied different methods (traditional logistic regression
and SVM models) to derive robust and stable models. Though a systematic review found no ben-
efit in machine learning over logistic regression in clinical prediction [34], machine learning may
perform better than logistic regression in smaller samples [35], and with high dimension data
[36]. The reason for using both logistic regression and SVM models was to increase the chances
that important variables would be included in the final prediction model. Though we used logistic
regression as the final predictive model, at the outset we did not know which variables would be
selected by which method. Using both methods to identify risk factor clusters may therefore have
been an advantage. Additionally, the training and validation datasets were from samples repre-
sentative of free-living older US adults. However, our study also has some limitations. For exam-
ple, the predictive properties of our model are in the acceptable range but are not excellent [37].
One possible reason for this is that the NHANES datasets were not specifically designed for evalu-
ating cognition. The model could be refined in a dataset with more accurate measures of cogni-
tion such as more extensive neurocognitive testing, and neuroimaging such as MRI and EEG
[38]. Another way to strengthen the model is by evaluating a wider range of risk factors such as
sleep, physical function, speech and hearing abilities, vision, reading history, access to healthcare,
social interactions, family engagement, and oral health [38–42]. Many of these factors have been
related with cognition but are not formally used to predict undiagnosed cognitive impairment.
For example, though poor oral health is associated with worse cognition, oral health information
is not widely used to predict impaired cognition. Another limitation is that the statistical
approach used to identify risk factors assumes that the model assumptions are met. For example,
to identify the initial set of possible predictors we used logistic regression, which assumes that the
relation between continuous risk factors and the log odds of the outcome are linearly related. A
violation of this assumption could result in loss of efficiency. To address this concern, we
repeated the variable selection process using machine learning methods which do not have this
limitation. The final list of predictors was obtained using information from both logistic regres-
sion and machine learning methods. Another limitation was that some domains were measured
differently in the development (NHANES III) and validation datasets (continuous NHANES
2011–2014). For example, the cognitive score assessed in the validation dataset used newer meth-
ods. Though we used the same overall criteria to evaluate cognitive impairment (lowest 10% of
cognition score) in both the development and validation datasets, cognitive assessment in the lat-
ter dataset was likely more accurate. This could also have reduced the predictive properties of the
model. Despite these limitations, the approach seems promising for clinical translation. For
example, based on the predicted probability of cognitive impairment obtained for a particular
patient from the model, a health care provider could decide whether to test that patient.
Conclusions
We developed a model consisting of 10 common risk factors that predicted undiagnosed cog-
nitive impairment in a representative sample of older US adults. This model could be used to
identify groups with greater prevalence of cognitive impairment in its current form to aid in
screening. This model could be enhanced, and its prediction improved by refining it in a richer
dataset with more accurate and varied outcome measures and a broader range of predictors.
